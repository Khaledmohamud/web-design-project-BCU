      <h1 id="What_is_Ransomware">What is ransomware</h1>
      <p>
      
        Ransomware is a form of malware specifically designed to deny a user or an organisation access to their computer. through the encryption of these files, a hacker holds a machine hostage until ransom is paid in exchange for the decryption key. some versions of this software have additional functionality such as the ability to steal data</p>
      <h1 id="Detecting_Ransomware">Detecting ransomware</h1>
      <p>A ransomware attac bares major cost to any person or business so it is imparative to detect an attack before any major risks arise. Luckily Ransomware is detectable  as it follows a specific chain of events known as  the cyber kill chain.</p>
        <h2 id="Recconessance">i)Recconessance</h2>
        <p>In Reconessance stage, the attackers focus on looking into your organization’s systems. This could be looking for viable breach opportunities by scanning ports or networks, or collecting information about the system and/or users

          To detect ransomware in the reconnaissance stage, your system must be capable of detecting any network or port scans that are performed.
          </p>
        <h2 id="Weaponization">
          ii)Weaponization </h2>
        <p>
          Weaponization refers to applying various techniques to the code after reconnaissance so it’s capable of evading memory-, network-, and/or file-based cyber defense measures employed by the targeted network. For example, attackers may make the payload look like a simple PDF or hide it inside a benign-looking word document.</p>
        <h2 id="Delivery">iii)Delivery</h2>
        <p>Within this stage, ransomware is being loaded into an organisation’s syste, this could be through the use of emails or through the use of stolen credentials or even by redirecting web traffic to a malicious site. Having a strongly secured device here is important in the case of infectio, because in the case of infection itcan now be approprietely quarentined</p>
        <h2 id="Exploitation">iv)Exploitation</h2>
        <p>This is the stage where the ransomware is now actually running on the victim machine.

          The fix for this is the use of secure passwords, security patching and continous network monitoring</p>
        <h2 id="Installation">v)Installation</h2>
        <p>After the first infection, the infection spreads throughout the network during the installation phase. Other ransomware kinds start their lateral movement on their own, albeit occasionally the malware need an external C2 communication to accomplish this. The system's files and any accessible backups are the targets of the malware.

          To successfully combat ransomware, a system should monitor for such C2 communications so an attack can be isolated. Additionally, traffic must be monitored, particularly for lateral east-west movement. By using machine learning to establish a baseline for a device's typical communication patterns, Ordr can notify users about lateral movement or unusual communications to a C2 location. To track users' access to the hardware, software, and systems on the network, Ordr also interfaces with Active Directory.</p>
        <h2 id="Command_and_Control">vi)Command and Control</h2>
        <p>Once the command and control phase has been attained, the hackers are communicating with the attacker domain (C2). They are present in the network and have probably already begun to encrypt and/or exfiltrate data in order to extort money. Now that they are in charge, the assailants demand a ransom.</p>
        <h1 id="Effects_of_Ransomware">Effects of Ransomware</h1>
        <p>The effects of ransomware attacks are nothing short of devastating. The following are the effects that a ransomware attack has on any business</p>
        <h2 id="Business_Loss">i)Business Loss</h2>
        <p>The hacking incident at Colonial Pipeline had a substantial and immediate impact.
      
          It had an impact on the aviation sector, as there was a shortage of jet fuel for numerous airlines, notably American Airlines. Other airports, like Atlanta and Nashville, had only minor interruption.
          
          
          
          Long lineups at gas stations and panicked petrol purchases were brought on by fear of a gas shortage in various states, including Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, and the Carolinas. In the wake of the Colonial Pipeline outage, the average price of gas increased as well, reaching a high of $3 per gallon. As people bought more fuel than normal, panic purchasing actually contributed to some serious shortages in some regions.
          
          
          
          Even people packed plastic bags with gasoline in several regions. This led to a United States Consumer Product</p>
        <h2 id="Ransom_Payments">i)Ransom Payments</h2>
        <p>
          To pay the ransom or not to pay the ransom will be one of the hardest decisions you'll have to make as a company. Although regulatory bodies around the world prohibit corporations from paying ransom, many companies nonetheless do so because they have no other choice.
          
          If you are attacked, you could end up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in ransom without any assurance that the attackers will truly release your data.
          
          Depending on the ransomware attack's style, the volume of data it encrypts, and the kind of business you run, the price can change. A huge organisation may have to pay millions in ransom payments, whilst a small business with minimal data may just have to pay a few hundred dollars to get their data returned.</p>
        <h2 id="Reputation_damage">Reputation damage</h2>
        <p>If word of the attack spreads, which it most likely will, your company's reputation could suffer significant harm. As a result of the attack, your current customers' private information and data may have leaked, making it difficult to not only keep your current clients and customers, but to deter others from working with your company or partnering with it in the future.</p>
        <h2 id="Regulatory_fines">Regulatory fines</h2>
        <p>
          If sensitive client data is compromised in the attack, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, adding financial stress to an already regrettable situation.</p>
